Scan the expression once from left to right.

 While (last symbol not processed) 
 { 
   Scan the next symbol, S 
   If S is an operand
       Append it to the postfix expression
   Endif
   If S is a left bracket
       Push it onto the stack 
   Endif 
   If S is a right bracket
       Pop and append all symbols from the stack until the most recent left bracket.
       Pop and discard the left bracket
   Endif 
   If S is an operator
       Pop and append to the postfix expression every operator from the stack that is
       above the most recently scanned left bracket and that has precedence greater
       than or equal to the new operator.
       Push the new operator on the stack 
   Endif 
 } 
	   Pop and append to the postfix string everything from the stack
